*k*-Means *N*-Ary Natural Implementation (NANI) is an algorithm for selecting initial centroids for *k*-Means clustering. NANI is an extension of the *k*-Means++ algorithm. NANI stratifies the data to high density region and perform diversity selection on top of the it to select the initial centroids. This is a deterministic algorithm that will always select the same initial centroids for the same dataset and improve on *k*-means++ by reducing the number of iterations required to converge and improve the clustering quality.

**A tutorial is available for NANI at [tutorials/nani.md](tutorials/nani.md).**
